# performance
Currently there are many edge-detecting algrithoms or nerual networks. But few of them has good performance on paintings, espatially those from comic or animate. Most of these existing methods just detect the edge and then add lines to the edge. However, we need a method to convert the painting to a sketch which looks like a painter drawed the outline of picture. It is important when we want to train a nerual networks to colorlize pictures.

Here a conclusion of existing methods to handle the problem.
